1.	A number between 5 and 20 chosen at random. The smallest possible
    number is 5 and the largest is 20.
2.	An integral value between 3 and 10. The largest number that
    could be seen is 9 and the smallest is 3.  No, as it is going between 3 and 10 only displaying the next two numbers in the sequence which are 2 after the previous number.
3.	A discrete uniform distribution, showing integers between the
    intervals of 2.5 and 5.5. The smallest number that could be
    generated is 2.5 and the largest is 5.4.
